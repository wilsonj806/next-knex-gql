# Next GQL Knex
## Overview
This is a quick tutorial project that runs a Next.js universal React app with Apoolo GraphQL/ Knex as the data layer of the app.

Code is based on this [example repo](https://github.com/bengrunfeld/nextjs-apollo-app)

## Local Development
You will need Node v12+ to run the app as well as a recent version of PostgreSQL. Docker is also recommended as you can take advantage of Docker Compose.

If you have Docker, then you can run `docker-compose up` to run the app locally.

If you don't have Docker, then you'll need to make some changes.
